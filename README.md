# LAGrad

An MLIR-based source-to-source automatic differentiation system.

## Building

This setup assumes that you have built LLVM and MLIR in `$BUILD_DIR` and installed them to `$PREFIX`. To build and launch the tests, run
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX/lib/cmake/mlir
cmake --build .
```
To build the documentation from the TableGen description of the dialect operations, run
```sh
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```
**Note**: Make sure to pass `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` when building LLVM with CMake in order to install `FileCheck` to the chosen installation prefix.

## Note for LLVM installation

Make sure to use the custom build scripts in the LLVM repo. Especially make sure to use the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag.
